# rcs_scripts
Scripts used by the RCS to maintain information on clans and their members

The **Reddit Clan System** is a family of clans that work together to enjoy the game, [Clash of Clans](https://clashofclans.com/).  We can pull API data from Supercell's servers and use it in Google Sheets, Discord, and more.

I'm sharing these scripts because there is a chance someone else might want to do something similar and could benefit from what we've already learned.

I am, by no means, an expert coder.  I'm just learning as I go.  If you see room for improvement, please let me know.
